# Melodi-A-Music-Theory-App

A continuation of a univerity project, as found here https://github.com/MarcOlivess/MelodiPrototypeWeb
The main goal after the original project was to remake pages as needed, and more fully flesh out my original idea for the site.
Various implimentations inspired from the original project as found above. 

## Design Process

First I decided what I wanted for the app, my largest objectives was to just make a friendly environment for those who would like to learn in an engaging way for those who would like to learn music theory. 
to accomplish this I wanted a non-crowded UI, and simple lessons and games. Overall trying to make it a friendly user experiance.

First I created sketches of the wireframes, then converted them into figma for my initial designs.

given the initial wireframes I mocked up a simple website through figma as well.

Over time the visuals and parameters where refined through user interviews,
building up on what exactly would be done to achieve the over arching goal of the website, 
with each user study things where changed or adjusted as necessary

Finally going forward this will be the new design after re-evaluating with fresh eyes after a while.

All the games work through javascript, the piano is a free use piano with credits inside the JS file. 



## In Progress
The next steps will be creating a database to be hosted by AWS in order to properly connect the backend.

Will be re-doing log in using google, and remaking all the pages with the new designs I settled on. 

Cleaning up files, restructuring, reorganizing, and adding in comments.
